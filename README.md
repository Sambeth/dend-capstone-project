## PROJECT SCOPE
This project focuses on the general practices in England, on the practice level, chemical level and presentation level. All registered practices, including GP practices, in England are included in the data, including a number of 'dummy' practices.

The practice level shows us what is practice is called, and the addresses of the practice.

The chemical level shows us what chemicals where prescribed or dispensed which include name of chemicals.

The presentation level similar to what the practice level data, shows us what is practice is called, the address of the practice, the number of genera practicioners with each practice. We also get the number of patients registered with each practice whether they are getting a dispensing service or medical services.

This project has 4 data sources.
Namely;
* practices.csv
* chem_subs.csv
* practice_presentation.csv
* practice_list_size_and_gd_count.csv
  
You can find the data dictionary [here](data_dictionary.md)

This data is a month on month dataset. I am using the December dataset by default which already has some 10 million rows.
What I hope to achieve from this dataset is to see some trends in drugs being prescribed? Can seasons be detected based on the type of drugs being described? Since these datasets have no information about the patients themselves, can it be easily determined what kind of patients are receiving certain services whether dispensing or medical services.
